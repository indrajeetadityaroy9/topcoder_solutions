| Problem | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| CollectBoxes | Sorts positions, uses prefix sums and precomputed minima to minimize total travel cost. |
| FlippingCoinSum | DP over signed sums to reach target difference and reconstruct flips. |
| MineSweeperStrings | DP counts valid strings with adjacency constraints, then lexicographically selects the X-th string. |
| NoteTakers | Floyd-Warshall + bipartite matching to build minimum path cover of feasible transitions. |
| NumReverseEasy | Sums `max(x, reverse(x))` across a range. |
| ReversalSorting | Greedy breakpoint reduction with reversals; outputs reversal indices. |
| Split | Meet-in-the-middle to optimize weighted partition cost. |
